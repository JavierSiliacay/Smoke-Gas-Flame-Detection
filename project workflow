1. Initial Setup

Connect the flame sensor to the A0 pin and the MQ2 gas sensor to the A1 pin.

Connect the LEDs to pins 5, 6, and 7 for flame, gas, and normal conditions respectively.

Connect the buzzer to pin 2.

Power the Arduino board.

2. Sensor Calibration

Read the values from the flame sensor and the MQ2 gas sensor using analogRead.

Implement smoothing for more stable readings by taking multiple samples and averaging them.

3. Logic to Check Conditions

Check the value of the flame sensor:

If the flame sensor value is below a threshold (e.g., 500), activate the flame detection process.

Check the value of the gas sensor:

If the gas sensor value is within a certain range (e.g., between 300 and 600), activate the gas detection process.

4. LED and Buzzer Responses

If a flame is detected, turn on the red LED and trigger a buzzer sound at 4kHz.

If gas or smoke is detected, turn on the orange LED and trigger a buzzer sound at 3.5kHz.

If no hazards are detected, turn on the green LED indicating normal condition.

5. Continuous Monitoring

The system continuously reads sensor data and checks the conditions in a loop.

It responds in real-time based on the sensor readings, ensuring safety alerts are triggered promptly.

6. Delays and Updates

Introduce a short delay to prevent continuous sensor reading in rapid succession (e.g., 200 milliseconds).

7. Final Output

The system outputs sensor readings and the status (flame, gas, or normal) to the Serial Monitor for debugging and verification.

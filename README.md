# Smoke-Gas-Flame-Detection
This project is a fire and gas detection system using Arduino. It utilizes a flame sensor and an MQ2 gas sensor to detect hazardous conditions. The system triggers a red LED and buzzer for flame detection and an orange LED with a different buzzer tone for gas detection. A green LED indicates normal conditions.
